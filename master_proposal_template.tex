\section*{Instructions}
This template provides a structured outline for your master thesis proposal and includes a time management exercise. Complete each section with brief responses (1–2 sentences or bullet points) to save time. After completing, push your updates to GitHub as practice.

\section{1. Summary}
What is the main purpose of your research, and why is it significant?\\
- the combination of ICON-MUSCAT needs to be varified 
- get my masters degree

\section{2. Research Background}
What previous research provides context for your study, and what gaps does it address?\\
- studys that show importance of meteorologiacal influence on CTMs --> new weather model --> how does it perform?
- already studies with this combination?
- studies about ozone, because simulations of ozone 

\section{3. Research Objectives (incl. Research Questions)}
State the main objectives of your research and outline specific research questions.
- ICON-MUSCAT model evaluation, ozone, (maybe particulate matter (PM)or other trace gases (NO, NO2)), measurement stations
- how well does the new ICON-MUSCAT model simulate trace gases and aerosols? (comparison to measurements) 
- Are there regional and temporal differences in the performances?

\section{4. Methods and Data}
Which methods will you use to answer your research questions, and why are they suitable?\\
- compare model output of trace gas concentration or one year (probably 2019) to measurements from this period 
- investigate differnt station types or different regions
- use meteorological output from model and measurements to investigate influence of meteorology?

\section{5. Timeline and Milestones (incl. Gantt Chart)}
What are the main stages of your research, and when do you plan to complete them?\\

\section{Exercise: Time Management Strategy}
Use this section to outline your weekly planning, prioritisation, and reflection. Keep responses short and focused.

\subsection*{Weekly Planning}
\textbf{Prompt:} List 1–2 key tasks you need to complete this week.\\
\textbf{Answer:}  email --> ask literatur, finish literature review, start an outline of proposal (structure, main points)
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Task Prioritisation}
 Categorise a few tasks as: 1. Urgent and Important, 2. Important but Not Urgent, 3. Urgent but Not Important, 4. Not Urgent and Not Important.\\
\textbf{Answer:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Urgent and Important: 
    \item Important but Not Urgent: 
    \item Urgent but Not Important: 
    \item Not Urgent and Not Important: 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reflection and Adjustment}
Briefly reflect on your progress this week. What went well? What challenges did you face?\\
\textbf{Answer:} 

\noindent
\textbf{Adjustment for Next Week:}
